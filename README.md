# fifo-verification-systemverilog
In this project, I developed a SystemVerilog testbench to verify the behavior of a given FIFO module design (fifo.sv).
The testbench generates randomized input transactions, drives them into the FIFO, and monitors the output. A verification monitor captures the transactions, while a reference model checks the output to ensure the FIFO is functioning correctly according to its specifications.
